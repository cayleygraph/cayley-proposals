# Cayley Enhancement Proposals

This is the repository for Cayley Enhancement Proposals (CEPs). Much like Python's PEPs, design docs for the [Cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) project live here.

To create a proposal, create a PR with your proposal in [Github-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) following the template, and make sure to add the proposal to the index as well.

* [Index of all proposals](INDEX.md)
